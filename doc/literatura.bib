In this report, we describe, summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware.",

abstract	=	"The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become an integral part of today's mainstream computing systems. Over the past six years, there has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly-parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in \emph{general-purpose computing on the GPU} (GPGPU), also known as \emph{GPU computing}, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications.

    abstract={The graphics processing unit (GPU) has made significant strides as an accelerator in parallel computing. However, because the GPU has resided out on PCIe as a discrete device, the performance of GPU applications can be bottlenecked by data transfers between the CPU and GPU over PCIe. Emerging heterogeneous computing architectures that "fuse" the functionality of the CPU and GPU, e.g., AMD Fusion and Intel Knights Ferry, hold the promise of addressing the PCIe bottleneck. In this
        paper, we empirically characterize and analyze the efficacy of AMD Fusion, an architecture that combines general-purpose x86 cores and programmable accelerator cores on the same silicon die. We characterize its performance via a set of micro-benchmarks (e.g., PCIe data transfer), kernel benchmarks(e.g., reduction), and actual applications (e.g., molecular dynamics). Depending on the benchmark, our results show that Fusion produces a 1.7 to 6.0-fold improvement in the
            data-transfer time, when compared to a discrete GPU. In turn, this improvement in data-transfer performance can significantly enhance application performance. For example, running a reduction benchmark on AMD Fusion with its mere 80 GPU cores improves performance by 3.5-fold over the discrete AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU with its 1600 more powerful GPU cores.},

    abstract={The Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is an Internet standards-track security profile for RTP used to provide confidentiality, integrity and replay protection for RTP traffic. We study the performance of SRTP when it is used to secure VoIP conversations. Experiments are conducted using snom and Twinkle softphones running on Windows and Linux platforms respectively and a bare PC softphone running with no operating system installed to provide a baseline. Pre-defined
        SRTP transforms based on AES counter mode encryption with a 128-bit key and HMAC-SHA-1 with a 32-bit authentication tag, as well as 192 and 256-bit AES keys and an 80-bit authentication tag are tested. Measurement of internal processing times for each operation in the SRTP protocol indicates that authentication processing is more expensive than encryption regardless of key or tag size. A comparison of jitter and delta (packet interarrival time) for secured and
            unsecured VoIP traffic reveals that the addition of SRTP protection to VoIP traffic over RTP has a negligible effect on voice quality. VoIP throughput with SRTP is about 2% more than with RTP alone since the insignificant increase in delay is offset by the small increase in packet size.},
